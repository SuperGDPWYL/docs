## Overview

A new antagonist subgamemode where the Station AI and its Cyborgs' laws are overridden. The silicons work together to achieve their prime directives while fighting against the crew in the process.

## Background

The Malfunctioning AI is based on the common acience-fiction trope of an evil AI -- think HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey or GLaDOS from Portal. It is also an antagonist present on most Space Station 13 servers, where it functions like a Traitor version of a Station AI.

## Features to be added

Give a description of what game mechanics you would like to add or change. This should be a general overview, with enough details on critical design points that someone can directly implement the feature from this design document. Exact numbers for game balance however are not necessary, as these can be adjusted later either during development or after it has been implemented, but mention *what* will have to be balanced and what needs to be considered when doing so.

## Game Design Rationale

Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../space-station-14/core-design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?
- What makes this feature enjoyable or rewarding for players?
- Does it introduce meaningful choices, risk vs. reward, or new strategies?
- How does it enhance player cooperation, competition, or emergent gameplay?
- If the feature is a new antagonist, how does it fit into the corresponding [design pillars](../space-station-14/round-flow/antagonists.md)?

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Consider addressing:
- At what point in the round does the feature come into play? Does it happen every round? How does it affect the round pace?
- How do you wish for players to interact with your feature and how should they not interact with it? How is this mechanically enforced?
- Which department will interact with the feature? How does the feature fit into the [design document](../space-station-14/departments.md) for that department?

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?
- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?
- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?

# Technical Considerations

- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones? Give a short technical outline on how they will be implemented.
- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
